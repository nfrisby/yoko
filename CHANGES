0.2 -> 0.4
===============

* drastic simplifications when writing the ICFP submission

* I'll eventually work those older features back in --- Though it is
  *extremely* unlikely, I apologize if you were using them.

0.1 -> 0.2
===============

* improved the treatment of automatically generating algebras
* emphasizing DCOf over DCU
* moved all of the documentation from README to http://code.google.com/p/yoko
* still obsessively tweaking names throughout the library
* improved the treatment of unique constructors
* added SiblingOf and a corresponding superclass constraint to DT
