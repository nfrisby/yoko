0.4 -> 0.9
===============

* I integrated all of the changes made during writing up my dissertation --
  mostly superficial/renamings, though I did realize that the DCsOf wrapper was
  superfluous.

* In particular, I renamed @exact_case@ to @precise_case@, which is
  polyvariadic in the ad-hoc cases. This makes for code that very much
  resembles a normal case expression.

0.2 -> 0.4
===============

* drastic simplifications when writing the ICFP submission

* I'll eventually work those older features back in --- Though it is
  *extremely* unlikely, I apologize if you were using them.

0.1 -> 0.2
===============

* improved the treatment of automatically generating algebras
* emphasizing DCOf over DCU
* moved all of the documentation from README to http://code.google.com/p/yoko
* still obsessively tweaking names throughout the library
* improved the treatment of unique constructors
* added SiblingOf and a corresponding superclass constraint to DT
